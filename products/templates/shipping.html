        <p><strong>Calculations of Taxes and Import Duties</strong></p>
        <p>For orders with Duties Delivered Paid, the import duties and taxes include in the price but it depends on the country for shipment. If not included with the price, you can find it at the checkout. As for orders with Duties Delivered Unpaid, the customer handles all the import duties and taxes, which he or she can take care at the customs.</p>
